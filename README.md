## ðŸ“¡ Homework 1 â€“ DoA Estimation, Range Estimation, MIMO Array, and Orthogonal Waveforms
**Objective:**  
Design and simulate a radar system capable of estimating the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of targets using a Uniform Linear Array (ULA), extending to range estimation, MIMO radar implementation, and orthogonal waveform transmission.

**Key Tasks:**
- DoA estimation using spatial frequency analysis.
- Design for 2Â° angular resolution.
- Range estimation with a wideband signal.
- MIMO array design for virtual aperture extension.
- Simulation of orthogonal waveforms to avoid mutual interference.

**Skills Applied:**  
MATLAB, array signal processing, resolution analysis, waveform design.

## ðŸ›° Homework 2 â€“ UAV-SAR Imaging with Time Domain Back Projection
**Objective:**  
Form a focused radar image using UAV-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the Time Domain Back Projection (TDBP) algorithm.

**Key Tasks:**
- Range resolution assessment.
- SAR image formation using TDBP.
- Despeckling with 2D moving average filters.
- Resolution measurement using corner reflectors.
- Analysis of trajectory error effects on SAR image quality.

**Skills Applied:**  
MATLAB, SAR imaging, image processing, resolution analysis.
